Device Initiated Firmware Sample

Following stand-alone samples (present in this project) demonstrate Device Management samples through IBM Watson IoT Platform.

Quickstart sample that connects to Watson IoT Quickstart service and publishes an event.
MQTT Device sample that publishes an event, every second to IBM Watson IoT Platform using MQTT.
HTTP Device sample that publishes an event, every second to IBM Watson IoT Platform using HTTP.
Command subscription sample that subscribes to commands while publishing device events to IBM Watson IoT Platform.

The samples are written using the Java Client Library for IBM Watson IoT Platform that simplifies the interactions with the IBM Watson IoT Platform.
